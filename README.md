# Banana-Ripeness-Detection-using-CNN

This project applies the Convolutional Neural Network to classify the ripeness of the banana. The system can either replace or aid human operators who can focus their efforts on fruit selection. The multi-input modelâ€™s quick processing time can be a useful and handy technique in the farm field. The maturity level of bananas has different benefits in terms of the color of the skin of a banana. The banana's ripeness is divided into three classes: unripe/green, ripen, and overripe. The experiment was conducted using several libraries such as OpenCV, Tensorflow. With small number of image samples, the system is capable of automating assembly line related work for classifying bananas along with sufficient overall accuracy.

## Feel free to ping me to discuss about the project.
